# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-17)

First public release.

- Hybrid search: BM25 over code-aware tokens merged with vector similarity
  from a local embedding model, so an identifier and a plain description of
  behaviour both find the right place. A chunk holding every term of the
  query ranks first even in a file with no declarations, such as a CI
  workflow or a config file.
- With the `treesitter` feature, chunks follow function and type boundaries in
  17 languages and carry the declaration's name, including JavaScript and
  TypeScript functions bound to a variable or class field. Doc comments become
  records of their own.
- `ripsem mcp` serves a single `search` tool over stdio and keeps the index
  current while it runs, also across a rebuild for another model. `ripsem install
  claude-code` and `ripsem install cursor` register it and add a note that tells
  the agent when to use it.
- `ripsem status` reports index size, model, backend and drift from the tree,
  as text or JSON (`ripsem/status/v1`).
- `ripsem watch` keeps the index in sync as files change, under the config as
  it is at each change.
- `ripsem completions <shell>` prints completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish,
  PowerShell and elvish.
- The index lives in `.ripsem/index.bin`, versioned and stored with bitcode. An
  index from another version, built by another backend or chunked with other
  settings is rebuilt by `ripsem index` instead of being misread or reused.
  `.ripsem/.gitignore` keeps it out of git.
- Release binaries for Linux x86_64 (glibc 2.35 or newer), macOS arm64 and
  Windows x86_64.
